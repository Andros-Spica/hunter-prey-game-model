How many individuals of an antelope species could be found (range) within an area of 10x10km of South African savanna?

---

The number of antelope individuals within a 10x10 km (100 km²) area of South African savanna can vary significantly depending on several factors, such as the specific antelope species, habitat quality, and environmental conditions.

### General Estimates
Here are rough population density ranges for some common antelope species in South African savannas:

1. **Impala (Aepyceros melampus)**:
   - Density: 5 to 30 individuals per km²
   - Estimated population in 100 km²: 500 to 3,000 individuals

2. **Kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros)**:
   - Density: 1 to 5 individuals per km²
   - Estimated population in 100 km²: 100 to 500 individuals

3. **Springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis)**:
   - Density: 2 to 15 individuals per km²
   - Estimated population in 100 km²: 200 to 1,500 individuals

4. **Blue Wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus)**:
   - Density: 1 to 10 individuals per km²
   - Estimated population in 100 km²: 100 to 1,000 individuals

### Factors Influencing Density
- **Habitat Quality**: Areas with abundant food and water resources support higher densities.
- **Predation and Competition**: High predation pressure or competition with other herbivores can lower densities.
- **Human Impact**: Protected areas typically have higher densities compared to regions impacted by hunting or agriculture.

If you need data for a specific species or region, more detailed studies or local wildlife surveys would be required.
